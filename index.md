## Freshgo, the golang version manager

Use freshgo to **easily** install and manage your golang versions.

freshgo can install the latest go version, or any given version of go. 

### Get easily started

Freshgo is an easy way to avoid manual actions for installing go and keeping it up to date.
You do not need **git** or any other tool to make this work.

### Get **Notified** for latest go version

Freshgo can run everytime your shell opens and check if there is a latest version than the one installed. If there is, it can ask you wether you'd like to update to the latest.

```
echo "${PATH to freshgo repo}/check_ver.sh >>  ~/.profile
```
